# EskomFunctions
This library was created to house a package of python functions to analyse and calculate data from Eskom, through processing numeric and text data as Eskom requires certain metrics to be calculated for their analytical team.
The package consists of list manipulation, dictionaries, basic stats and aggregations  as well as data clean up, all of which were implemented under the PEP8 coding style guidelines.
